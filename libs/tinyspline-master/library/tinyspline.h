 * Represents a B-Spline which may also be used for NURBS, Bezier curves,

 * B-Splines with 'n_ctrlp == order' and clamped knot vector making the curve
 * passing through the first and last control point. If a Bezier curve consists
 * of two control points only, we call them a line. Points, ultimately, are
 * just very short lines having only a single control point. Consequently, the
 * degree of a point is zero.
 *
 * Two dimensional control points are organized as follows:
 *
 *     [x_0, y_0, x_1, y_1, ..., x_n-1, y_n-1]
 *
 * Tree dimensional control points are organized as follows:
 *
 *     [x_0, y_0, z_0, x_1, y_1, z_1, ..., x_n-1, y_n-1, z_n-1]
 *
 * ... and so on. NURBS are represented using homogeneous coordinates. For
 * instance, let's say we have a NURBS in 2D consisting of 11 control points
 * where 'w_i' is the weight of the i'th control point. Then the corresponding
 * control points are organized as follows:
 *
 *     [x_0, y_0, w_0, x_1, y_1, w_1, ..., x_10, y_10, w_10]

 *       approach used in 'tsDeBoorNet'). That is, the first elements of this
 *       array contain the control points of a spline whereas the last elements
 *       contain its knots. Accordingly, you should never free 'knots'
 *       explicitly. Using 'ts_bspline_free()' to free dynamically allocated
 *       memory is to be preferred anyway. If 'ctrlp' and 'knots' do not share
 *       the same array, or at least a consistent block of data, functions
 *       provided by TinySpline my fail because values are copied block wise.

/**
 * Represents the output of De Boor's algorithm. De Boor's algorithm is used to

 *     https://www.cs.mtu.edu/~shene/COURSES/cs3621/NOTES/spline/de-Boor.html
 *
 * All points of the net are stored in 'points'. The resulting point of an
 * evaluation is the last point in 'points' and, for the sake of convenience,
 * may be accessed using 'result':
 *
 *     tsDeBoorNet net = ...    // evaluate an arbitrary spline and store
 *                              // resulting net of points in 'net'
 *
 *     net.result ...           // use 'result' to access resulting point
 *
 * Note: You should never free 'result' explicitly as it is just a convenient
 *       accessor for the last point in 'points'. Using 'ts_deboornet_free()'
 *       to free dynamically allocated memory is to be preferred anyway.
 *
 * Two dimensional points are organized as follows:
 *
 *     [x_0, y_0, x_1, y_1, ..., x_n-1, y_n-1]
 *
 * Tree dimensional points are organized as follows:
 *
 *     [x_0, y_0, z_0, x_1, y_1, z_1, ..., x_n-1, y_n-1, z_n-1]
 *
 * ... and so on.
 *
 * There is a special case in which the evaluation of a knot value 'u' returns
 * two instead of one result. It occurs when the multiplicity of 'u' ( s(u) )
 * is equals to a spline's order indicating that the spline is discontinuous at
 * 'u'. This is common practice for B-Splines (or NURBS) consisting of
 * connected Bezier curves where the endpoint of curve 'c_i' is equals to the
 * start point of curve 'c_i+1'. The end point of 'c_i' and the start point of
 * 'c_i+1' may still be completely different though, yielding to a spline
 * having a (real and visible) gap at 'u'. Consequently, De Boor's algorithm
 * must return two results if 's(u) == order' in order to give you access to
 * the desired points.  In such case, 'points' stores only the two resulting
 * points (there is no net to create) and 'result' points to the *first* point
 * in 'points' ('points' and 'result' store the same pointer). Since having
 * (real) gaps in splines is unusual, both points in 'points' are generally
 * equals making it easy to handle this special case by accessing 'result' as
 * already shown above for regular cases:
 *
 *     tsDeBoorNet net = ...    // evaluate a spline which is discontinuous at
 *                              // at given knot value yielding to a net with
 *                              // two results
 *
 *     net.result ...           // use 'result' to access resulting point
 *
 * However, you can use both points if necessary:
 *
 *     tsDeBoorNet net = ...    // evaluate a spline which is discontinuous at
 *                              // at given knot value yielding to a net with
 *                              // two results
 *
 *     net.result[0] ...        // 'result[0]' stores the first component of
 *                              // the first point
 *
 *     net.result[net.dim]      // 'result[net.dim]' stores the first component
 *                              // of the second point
 *
 * As if this wasn't complicated enough, there is an exception for our special
 * case yielding to exactly one result (just like the regular case) even if
 * 's(u) == order'. It occurs when 'u' is the lower or upper bound of a
 * spline's domain. For instance, if 'b' is a spline with domain [0, 1] and is
 * evaluated at 'u = 0' or 'u = 1' then 'result' is *always* a single point
 * regardless of the multiplicity of 'u'. Hence, handling this exception is
 * straightforward:
 *
 *     tsDeBoorNet net = ...    // evaluate a spline at lower or upper bound of
 *                              // its domain, for instance, 0 or 1
 *
 *     net.result ...           // use 'result' to access resulting point
 *
 * In summary, we have three different types of evaluation. 1) The regular case
 * returning all points of the net we used to calculate the resulting point. 2)
 * The special case returning exactly two points which is required for splines
 * having (real) gaps. 3) The exception of 2) returning exactly one point even
 * if 's(u) == order'. All in all this looks quite complex (and actually it is)
 * but for most applications you don't need to bother with them. Just use
 * 'result' to access your evaluation point.

* TinySpline is a library focusing on transformations. That is, most          *
* functions are used to transform splines by modifying their state, e.g.,     *
* their number of control points, their degree, and so on. Accordingly, each  *
* transformation functions specifies an input and output parameter (along     *

* By passing a different pointer to the output parameter, the transformation  *
